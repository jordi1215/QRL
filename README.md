This repository is created for the final project of CS 394R: Reinforcement Learning taken at UT, Austin.

Project Contributors are: Jordi Ramos and Benjamin Pachev.

We decided to show our work in a notebook format with a link to our original Google Colab file. This way, the graders can see our results clearly. We have the following three files:

## SARSA
This shows our work in replicating the TD(0) algorithm mentioned in the original paper by Dong and al. We have implemented the Gridworld ourselves, as long as the SARSA algorithm while referencingn the algorithm in the textbook on page 130.
## QRL
This shows our work in replicating the QRL algorithm from the original paper by Dong and al., and the results.
## Grover's Algorithm Using Qiskit
This shows our attempt in trying to run the Grover's algorithm on a real quantum computer. We have succesfully implemented the quantum gates for the Grover's algorithm. All we need to do next is to schedule a job on a real quantum computer and anaylze the results. Our original plan is to run QRL on a real quantum computer, but found out that it is not yet possible. See our report for details.

You are able to run all three notebooks individually.

We have also included our presentation slides in a pdf format.
